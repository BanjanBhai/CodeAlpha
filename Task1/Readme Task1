Stock Prediction  
Take stock price of any company you want and predicts its price by using LSTM.  
  
Now Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  
LSTM networks are well-suited for time-series data, like stock prices, because they can capture temporal dependencies and patterns.  
The goal is to use past stock prices to predict future ones.  
For this task, we use Apple's (AAPL) stock data from Yahoo Finance from 2010 to 2023.  

For more accurate predictions, we should:  
Use a more complex model architecture.  
Tune hyperparameters like batch size, epochs, and the number of LSTM units.  
Incorporate additional features such as trading volume, other technical indicators, or external factors like economic data.
